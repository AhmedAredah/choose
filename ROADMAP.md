## Version 2.0
- [ ] Clean up code and/or port to something easier to work with (maybe something that can be platform-agnostic like ReasonML + [Revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery)/[Brisk](https://github.com/briskml/brisk)/[Cuite](https://github.com/let-def/cuite)
- [ ] Write more documentation and support manpage illustrating extra functionality

## Post Version 1.0 Cleanup
- [ ] Move vim to proper plugin structure and/or check desire from community to support
